Is Johnny Making Progress?
To train for an upcoming marathon, Johnny goes on one long-distance run each Saturday. He wants to track how often the number of miles he runs exceeds the previous Saturday. This is called a progress day.

Create a function that takes in a list of miles run every Saturday and returns Johnny's total number of progress days.

Examples
progress_days([3, 4, 1, 2]) ? 2
# There are two progress days, (3->4) and (1->2)

progress_days([10, 11, 12, 9, 10]) ? 3

progress_days([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 9]) ? 1

progress_days([9, 9])  ? 0
