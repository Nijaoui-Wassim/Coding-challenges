Jake's Meal Time
Jake is a very habitual person. He eats breakfast at 7:00 a.m. each morning, lunch at 12:00 p.m. and dinner at 7:00 p.m. in the evening.

Create a function that takes in the current time as a string and determines the duration of time before Jake's next meal. Represent this as a list with the first and second elements representing hours and minutes, respectively.

Examples
time_to_eat("2:00 p.m.") ➞ [5, 0]
// 5 hours until the next meal, dinner

time_to_eat("5:50 a.m.") ➞ [1, 10]
// 1 hour and 10 minutes until the next meal, breakfast
